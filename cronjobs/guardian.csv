A 16-year-old Madonna played her first gig there. Photographer Maripol was the store manager. At the Milan store, meanwhile, Haring was charged with painting the walls.

Similarly, despite the fact that bike courier Maggie Dewhurst wears a CitySprint uniform, has a CitySprint ID and delivers goods only for CitySprint, the company claimed she was an independent contractor, ie running an independent courier business, and used this as an excuse to not give her holiday pay.

Dont they realise we rearrange our internal organs every time we dance it?</p> <p>Brown grew up in Aberdeen, Washington state, the daughter of Martell Brown, a salesman, and his wife, Dorothy (nee Abel), a teacher. After graduating from Weatherwax high school in the city in 1954 she went to Mills College, in Oakland, California, to study modern dance, supplementing her course with the American Dance Festivals annual summer school, where her teachers included the choreographer Merce Cunningham and the veteran dance and music pedagogue Louis Horst.</p>",5,"Trisha Brown, choreographer who revolutionized dance in the 20th century, dies at 80 - https://t.co/2zP7S7D5Ct (Washington Post)||This weekend: dance!
